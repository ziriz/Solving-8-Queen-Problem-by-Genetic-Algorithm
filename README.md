# Solving-8-Queen-Problem-by-Genetic-Algorithm

This repository has code for solving 8-Queen Problem using Genetic Algorithm (GA) written in Python 3. Roulette-Wheel selection method is adapted for identifying suitable candidates for next iteration. Single Point Crossover method is used for Crossover operation. Mutation is carried out using Uniform Mutation.

Tested the code for N-Queen Problems where N=[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] using the parameters set in the code and correct results are obtained. For higher size problems, the parameters such as Initial Population size, Mutation Rate and Crossover Rate needs to be tuned and verified.
